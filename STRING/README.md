# 🔹 String Data Structures – DSA in C

This folder contains **commonly asked String problems** implemented in **C language**.  
These problems are essential for **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**,  
**interviews**, and **Advanced Programming Practice (APP)** coursework.

## 📌 List of Problems Covered

### 1️⃣ Reverse a String
**Problem:**  
Reverse a given string.

**Approach:**  
- Use two pointers (start & end)  
- Swap characters until pointers meet  

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### 2️⃣ Valid Palindrome
**Problem:**  
Determine whether a string is a palindrome, considering **only alphanumeric characters** and **ignoring case**.

**Approach:**  
- Use two pointers  
- Skip non-alphanumeric characters  
- Compare characters case-insensitively  

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### 3️⃣ Valid Anagram
**Problem:**  
Check whether two strings are anagrams of each other.

**Approach:**  
- Use a frequency array  
- Increment for first string and decrement for second  

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### 4️⃣ Longest Common Prefix
**Problem:**  
Find the longest common prefix among an array of strings.

**Approach:**  
- Use vertical scanning  
- Compare characters column by column  

**Time Complexity:** O(n × m)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)  

(`n` = number of strings, `m` = length of shortest string)

---

### 5️⃣ Count Vowels in a String
**Problem:**  
Count the number of vowels present in a given string.

**Approach:**  
- Traverse the string once  
- Check for both uppercase and lowercase vowels  

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### 6️⃣ Remove Duplicate Characters from String
**Problem:**  
Remove duplicate characters while **preserving the original order**.

**Approach:**  
- Use a visited/frequency array  
- Keep only the first occurrence of each character  

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)
