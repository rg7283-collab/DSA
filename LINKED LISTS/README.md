# 🔹 Linked List – DSA in C

This folder contains **fundamental Linked List problems** implemented in  
**C programming language**. These problems are essential for understanding  
**pointer manipulation**, **dynamic memory**, and are frequently asked in  
**DSA exams**, **interviews**, and **Advanced Programming Practice (APP)**.

## 📌 List of Problems Covered

### 1️⃣ Reverse a Singly Linked List
**Problem:**  
Reverse the nodes of a singly linked list.

**Approach:**  
- Use three pointers: `prev`, `current`, `next`
- Reverse links one by one

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### 2️⃣ Detect Cycle in a Linked List
**Problem:**  
Determine whether a linked list contains a cycle (loop).

**Approach:**  
- Use Floyd’s Cycle Detection Algorithm (Tortoise & Hare)
- Two pointers move at different speeds

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### 3️⃣ Find the Middle of a Linked List
**Problem:**  
Identify the middle node of a linked list.  
(If even length, return the second middle node.)

**Approach:**  
- Use slow and fast pointers
- Fast moves two steps, slow moves one step

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### 4️⃣ Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists
**Problem:**  
Merge two sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.

**Approach:**  
- Compare nodes from both lists
- Attach the smaller node to the merged list

**Time Complexity:** O(n + m)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### 5️⃣ Remove Nth Node from End
**Problem:**  
Remove the Nth node from the end of a linked list.

**Approach:**  
- Use two pointers with a dummy node
- Move fast pointer `n` steps ahead

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)
